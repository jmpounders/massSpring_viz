# Mass-Spring System Visualization

This [Processing](https://processing.org/) script shows a mass-spring dynamical system.  I will post background info and technical details at a later time...

Here are a couple of screen shots.  The actual script is animated with the two masses bouncing back and forth.  The curve overhead is a running plot of their displacements.

(This was originally developed as a demo for my Applied Engineering Problem Solving class at UMass Lowell to help the students understand what eigenmodes "look like".)
